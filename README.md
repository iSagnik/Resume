## Requirements and Compilation (from Lim)

* pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
* AltaCV uses [`fontawesome`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons); they're included in both TeX Live 2016 and MikTeX 2.9.
* Loading `academicons` is optional: enable it by adding the `academicons` option to `\documentclass`.
* Can now be compiled with pdflatex, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX!
* However, if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If the doc compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with LuaLaTeX instead.
* The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font.
